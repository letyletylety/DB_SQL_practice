# SHS

Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. 
If there is no second highest salary, the query should report null.

```sql
SELECT
    (SELECT DISTINCT
            Salary
        FROM
            Employee
        ORDER BY Salary DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary
;
```
